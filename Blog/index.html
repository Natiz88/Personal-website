            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Covid, technology and student life</h1>
            <p>2021/05/25 <br>Natiz Bista <br> <br>A period of just few months, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus has radically transformed the lives of masses of people around the globe, including students.For most students school isn’t just about academics, it is also about social interactions. Many friendships started by sitting next to each other in class. The highlight of a student’s day might be walking down a certain hallway between fifth and sixth period because that’s when she can reliably expect to see the person she has a crush on. Groups of friends eat lunch together every day. Through their interactions with teachers and other school personnel young people learn to interact with non-family authority figures. In the hallways and classrooms of their school, young people are exposed to a variety of different cultures, perspectives and ways of living that may be different than their own. <br> <br> <br>  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many colleges and universities are adopting online schooling, remote work, and other activities in a big way to help stop the virus from spreading. In the last decade, colleges and universities have realized the value of advising, early alerts, degree preparation, and other programs in assisting students in achieving their learning goals in a cost-effective and timely manner. A plethora of innovative apps and technology to aid student progress are now available, and they may prove invaluable in assisting students in their transition to truly remote learning. Many, but not all, institutions, teachers, professors, and staff are ready and willing to use these technologies, according to EDUCAUSE data from 2019. <br> <br>Digital technology in education enables us to find new answers not only to what people learn but also to how they learn, where and when they learn. On top of that, digital technology can help boost the role of teachers. Rather than just communicating knowledge, they can become co-creators of knowledge, coaches, mentors and evaluators.Existing digital learning systems, for example, can go far beyond mere teaching. Empowered by Artificial Intelligence, these systems can also observe how students learn. Besides, they can discover what kind of tasks and thinking interests them the most, and what kind of problems they find boring or difficult. These systems can then adapt the learning process to accommodate individual students’ learning styles. And, most important of all, they can do this with much more precision than any traditional classroom setting could ever achieve.</p>
